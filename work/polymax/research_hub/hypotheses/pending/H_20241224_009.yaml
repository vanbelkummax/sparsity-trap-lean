hypothesis:
  claim: Spatial smoothness constraint (neighboring bins should have correlated gene
    expression) will improve SSIM by 5-12% by regularizing toward biologically plausible
    spatial patterns
  minimal_test: 'Add L_spatial = -correlation(predicted[bin_i], predicted[neighbors(bin_i)])
    to Poisson loss. Use k=8 neighbors (same as GNN). Train with weight alpha=1.0.
    Measure: (1) Spatial autocorrelation (Morans I) before/after, (2) SSIM improvement,
    (3) Visual assessment of boundary sharpness'
  kill_shot: If spatial autocorrelation not significantly higher (p>0.05) OR SSIM
    degrades OR constraint causes over-smoothing (loss of glandular boundaries), abandon
  ev_estimate: 6.5
  rationale: 'Gene expression has strong spatial autocorrelation - nearby cells have
    similar expression due to shared niche/microenvironment. PINNs use spatial smoothness
    constraints to improve predictions in under-sampled regions (reduces errors 2
    orders of magnitude per 2024 research). Your glandular structure results show
    boundaries are critical - spatial constraint should preserve these while smoothing
    noise. Hist2ST already has GNN path for neighborhood structure, but its not explicitly
    optimized for spatial coherence. Adding correlation-based loss could enhance this.
    Risk: Over-smoothing could blur sharp boundaries (crypt lumen vs epithelium).
    Need to tune weight carefully or use adaptive weighting based on local variance.'
