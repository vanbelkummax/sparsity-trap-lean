hypothesis:
  claim: Adding physics-informed conservation constraints (total RNA per bin is bounded)
    to Hist2ST decoder will reduce biologically implausible predictions by 15-25%
    without degrading SSIM
  minimal_test: 'Modify Poisson loss to include soft constraint: sum(predicted_lambda
    across all 50 genes) should approximate observed total UMI count per bin. Train
    on P1+P2 with constraint weight lambda=0.1. Measure: (1) % of bins violating biology
    (sum > max observed), (2) SSIM vs unconstrained baseline, (3) Pearson correlation
    for total counts'
  kill_shot: If SSIM degrades >3% OR constraint doesnt reduce violations by ≥10% OR
    training becomes unstable (loss oscillation), abandon
  ev_estimate: 7.0
  rationale: 'Gene expression obeys conservation laws: total RNA per cell/bin is finite
    and bounded. Current Poisson models can predict biologically impossible combinations
    (all 50 genes highly expressed in one bin → total UMI >> max observed). Physics-informed
    neural networks (PINNs) achieve 2 orders of magnitude accuracy improvement by
    incorporating physical priors. For gene expression: (1) Conservation: sum(expression)
    ~ constant, (2) Spatial smoothness: neighboring bins should correlate, (3) Non-negativity:
    enforced by exp() in Poisson. Your data shows total UMI count varies by tissue
    region - enforcing this as soft constraint could regularize predictions toward
    biologically feasible space. Similar to how mass conservation improves fluid dynamics
    modeling in PINNs.'

- 'Design conservation loss: L_conservation = (sum(predicted) - observed_total)^2'
- Tune constraint weight lambda via grid search (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0)
- Measure biological plausibility before/after constraint
- 'If successful, explore other constraints: spatial smoothness, gene co-expression
