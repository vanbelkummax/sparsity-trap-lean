hypothesis:
  claim: Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) will NOT significantly improve over standard
    Poisson for 2um spatial transcriptomics because excess zeros are biological (low
    expression in stroma/lumen), not technical dropout
  minimal_test: 'Train with ZIP loss (mixture of Poisson + point mass at zero with
    learnable mixing weight pi). Measure: (1) Learned pi values per gene, (2) SSIM
    vs Poisson baseline, (3) Zero-prediction accuracy. Hypothesis: pi will be near
    0 (no zero-inflation needed) for most genes'
  kill_shot: If pi > 0.3 for majority of genes AND ZIP SSIM improves >5% over Poisson,
    abandon hypothesis (zero-inflation IS present)
  ev_estimate: 3.5
  rationale: 'Recent Genome Biology paper (2022) argues modeling zero inflation is
    NOT necessary for spatial transcriptomics - excess zeros are biological, not technical.
    Unlike scRNA-seq (where dropout causes technical zeros), Visium HD bins that are
    zero simply have no cells/low expression. Your sparsity analysis supports this:
    zeros correlate with tissue architecture (stromal regions have low epithelial
    gene expression). ZIP adds complexity without benefit if zeros are structural.
    Testing this validates/refutes the Genome Biology claim for 2um resolution specifically.
    Low EV because literature suggests it wont work, but worth validating.'

  notes: This is a NEGATIVE hypothesis - testing to confirm ZIP is NOT needed
next_steps:
- Implement ZIP loss (mixture of Poisson + delta at zero)
- Train and extract learned pi (zero-inflation probability) per gene
- If pi ~ 0 for most genes → validates that zeros are biological
- If pi > 0.3 → rethink, maybe technical dropout exists at 2um
