hypothesis:
  claim: Newer foundation models (Virchow 2.5, Prov-GigaPath, H-optimus-0) will outperform
    Virchow2 as encoders for 2um prediction, improving SSIM by 5-10% due to better
    morphological feature extraction
  minimal_test: Swap frozen encoder from Virchow2 to each newer model (Virchow 2.5,
    Prov-GigaPath, H-optimus-0) while keeping Hist2ST decoder + Poisson loss unchanged.
    Train on P1+P2, test on P5. Measure SSIM and PCC for each encoder
  kill_shot: If no encoder improves SSIM by ≥3% over Virchow2 baseline OR inference
    time increases >2x OR embedding dimension incompatibility requires major architecture
    changes, abandon
  ev_estimate: 6.0
  rationale: 'Virchow2 was state-of-art in 2024 but newer models have emerged: Virchow
    2.5 (improved training), Prov-GigaPath (gigapixel whole-slide pretraining), H-optimus-0
    (multi-modal histology foundation model). These models may capture finer morphological
    details relevant at 2um resolution. Your results show encoder quality matters
    (Hist2ST > Img2ST likely due to better feature extraction). Foundation models
    are improving rapidly - benchmarking latest models is low-hanging fruit. Risk:
    Newer models may be optimized for different tasks (diagnosis, not gene expression
    prediction) and may not transfer well.'

  notes: Quick benchmark - can be done in parallel with other experiments
next_steps:
- Check which newer foundation models have publicly available weights
- Extract embeddings from each model for same test slide
- Visualize embedding space via t-SNE/UMAP - do they separate tissue types better?
- If embeddings look promising, do full training
- 'Consider ensemble: combine embeddings from multiple foundation models (related
  to H_20241224_002 TICON unification)'
